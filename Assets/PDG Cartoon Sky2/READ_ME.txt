PDG Cartoon Sky
---------------

Thank you for purchasing this asset and supporting future projects and updates!


Overview:

This Asset includes 3 "toon-ish" skyboxes (bright, sunset and night setting)

Textures are 2048x2048 (will be automatically resized by unity, when build an app 
for iPhone or android, so adaption for mobile devices is easy as 1-2-3)


How to use this asset
---------------------
To change a skybox, just go Edit->Render Settings->and choose a “Skybox Material”
(All materials named “SkyBox” are what their names indicate – skyboxes)

Remember to adjust the overall lighting (Edit->Render Settings) to fit the mood of a chosen skybox. The lighting in the demo scene is suited to “SkyBox1” (the bright sky)
A scene may not look right, when changing a skybox but not adjusting the lighting accordingly!
